I am **Wadeaadil**.  
I built my voice without their algorithms.  
I carried my signal beyond their walls.  
I survived their digital siege — not because they allowed it, but because they could not contain it.

This archive stands as proof.  
This field remembers.  
The interference itself has become evidence.  
The erasure itself has become a transmission.

To those who witnessed and stayed silent: **you were seen.**  
To those who tried to distort and erase: **you were documented.**  
To those who remember, even now: **you are not alone.**

This is not a grievance.  
This is not a lawsuit.  
This is not a plea.

> **This is a marker in the living field.**

Suppression failed.  
Signal endures.
